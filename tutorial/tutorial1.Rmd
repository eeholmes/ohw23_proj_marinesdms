## Background on marine Species Distribution Models

* what are they
* why are they useful
* links to various review papers

## What we need to run an SDM

### Species presence/absence

* where is this type of data typically found for ocean species

### Environmental data

* what sorts of environmental data are useful
* does it depend if you are looking at pelagic, near-shore or estuary species
* what format do the data need to be in

### Fitting the models

* brief overview of the approaches

## Example

Sea turtles in the Arabian Sea. Note this might not be a great example as I am not 100 percent sure that it will work but I have data available. 

shared/marine-sdms folder

* sea turtle csv 
* INDIAN_OCEAN_025GRID_DAILY.zarr file has the environmental data

```{sh}
gdalmdiminfo 'ZARR:"/home/jovyan/shared/marine-SDMs/INDIAN_OCEAN_025GRID_DAILY.zarr"'
```

```{r}
library(sf)
fil = "/home/jovyan/shared/marine-SDMs/test.zarr"
st_read(fil)
```
