# ohw23_proj_marinesdms: Marine species distribution model (SDM) tutorial
This tutorial was developed during [OceanHackWeek](https://oceanhackweek.org/) by members of the Marine Species Distribution Model group. It shows a simple workflow to develop a marine SDM focusing on the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.  
  
## Requirements
Some experience programming in `R` is needed to make the most of this tutorial. To run this tutorial make sure you clone this repository into your local machine by creating a new project that uses version control (`git`).  
  
The tutorial content was developed in a `R` version 4.2.2 for Linux. Full session information is included below:

### Additional resources
If you need additional support with `R` programming, you can check the following resources:  
- [`R` for Data Science - 2nd edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Wickham, Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund.  
- [Data analysis and visualisation in `R` for ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/)  
  
For information on how to use `git` and `GitHub` with `R`, [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan is a great resource.
